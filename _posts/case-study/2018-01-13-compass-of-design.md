- User Experience Design
- UI Designer
goals:
- Create a lasting, recognizable brand
- Generate a strong brand framework that can carry future projects and products
- Generate enough buzz to grow their design community to 2x their size
challenge:
- Compass of Design is new to the space of design education. So what they lack in years of having an early ticket, they needed to make up for in relevance.
- This relevance is often misinterpreted as keeping up with design trends, and instead needs to showcase the willingness to experiment, learn, teach, and repeat.
- So with strategy as the focus, we needed to shape the brand to encompass the ability to experiment with the double effect of being able to stay on-brand.
