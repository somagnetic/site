title: Compass of Design
project: Build the branding framework and brand identity for Compass of Design â€” A designer resource platform
blurb: What started in late December of 2016 as a newsletter about Designing iwth confidence, Compass of Design started to grow past the short blurbs of confidence tips for designers. <br/><br/>We've run a long partnership with Compass of Design this past year to help culture and develop the brand that carries with it a strong solid foundation and framework for the execution of their strategy to build one of the best places for designers to congregate online. These designers within the community are serious about finding ways to improve their craft. Together, we built upon existing brand goals to solidify and amplify the brand's reach and awareness.

description: We worked with Compass of Design to completely design the brand experience for new designers looking to level up their skills. This project included digital designs, product and packaging design, with user and brand experience.
team:
- Darian Rosebrook
role:
- Creative Director
goals:
- Create a lasting, recognizable brand
- Generate a strong brand framework that can carry future projects and products
- Generate enough buzz to grow their design community to 2x their size
challenge:
- Compass of Design is new to the space of design education. So what they lack in years of having an early ticket, they needed to make up for in relevance.
- This relevance is often misinterpreted as keeping up with design trends, and instead needs to showcase the willingness to experiment, learn, teach, and repeat.
- So with strategy as the focus, we needed to shape the brand to encompass the ability to experiment with the double effect of being able to stay on-brand.
