title: Compass of Design
blurb: We've run a long partnership with Compass of Design this past year to help culture and develop the brand that carries with it a strong solid foundation and framework for the execution of their strategy to build one of the best places for designers to congregate online. These designers within the community are serious about finding ways to improve their craft. Together, we built upon existing brand goals to solidify and amplify the brand's awareness.
