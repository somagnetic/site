title: Logo Design for Professional Business and Residential Cleaners â€” The Glass Frontier
study_title: The Glass Frontier
project: Create a new logo identity for The Glass Frontier
blurb: In the city of anchorage, there are more than 50 businesses that serve businesses and residential homes with window, roof, and gutter cleaning. How do you show the level of quality and detail of service in a way that leads other people to choose your service?
substudy_title: Logo Design, Social Media Avatar, Vehicle Branding, and Framework
description: The founder of The Glass Frontier brought us on to reach their goal of building a strong and reliable brand that represents them as the best price and most communicative with amazing customer service
team:
- Darian Rosebrook
role:
- Creative Director
goals:
- Showcase friendly and detailed in the same logo design
- Position themselves as a reputable choice based on first brand interaction
- Showcase service quality and expertise in their field
challenge:
- The Glass Frontier is a company that works with small businesses and residential homes to clean the exterior gutters, windows, and roof, keeping businesses gleaming and appealing to customers.
- Currently, The Glass Frontier is working on building their brand in order to be outrunning their competition from the getgo.
- Their current challenge was showcasing their brand as the right choice to home and business owners in a place of vast marketplace competition.
- The design will need to work with small materials like business cards, hats, and t-shirts as well as with large applications like signage, vehicle decals, and more.
opportunities: The design by itself isn't going to be the driver in acquiring new business, however, what the brand mark and logo design is intended to do is show that the business is commited to quality and worth the investment. The design can showcase both detail-oriented results as well as a friendly and approachable brand. The mark would have to be memorable and bold, yet simple enough to recall when recommending or recalling the service providers for window and roof cleaning.
outcome:
- The end result is a logo that artfully gives a personal connection using rounded corners and the human element of custom hand lettering. Though the business has yet to open, they are prepared from the gates with a logo that plays on the history of handyman services and current design that appeals to more than one market.
- The final logo works to capture attention and remain legible at a plethora of sizes along with different marks for different uses.
- We'll update when the logo design is live.

"This project was done in a tight timeframe of two weeks. I got to work with Zack, the founder of The Glass Frontier to connect the extensive vision he has for his service to the visual design he was looking forward to building his brand. As with most service companies, there's a lot of competition out there, and a lot of people so focused on work that good design gets left behind. I wanted to capture a bit of that classic good design with a great representation of his service and level of quality."

We needed to make sure that based on the decisions that person makes each day to run their clinical trial, that making the decision to hire her is as sure fire and natural as the other companies and products they use during their daily tasks.

Our resulting design then put together a research file of all the materials and companies that these directors come across which served as a quality filter for any concept designs that So Magnetic came up with during the development of the logo design.
