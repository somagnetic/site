kind_words: It's very difficult when it seems like you're taking three steps back for every one step forward. I'm glad that I got you, [So Magnetic], involved when I did. Thank you for the help with refocusing my efforts on presentation and branding. You'd have laughed at how my things looked before hand that I made with my printer at home.
