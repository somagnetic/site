testimony: I had been struggling, trying to grow my business this last year. I wanted to move my business to fit a more premium market. Getting Darian and So Magnetic involved early on in that transition, we were able to get everything designed the way that it should have been at the start. I'm so excited to use our new logo on our shopping bags! Thanks!
