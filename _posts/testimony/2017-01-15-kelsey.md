testimony: I had been having a lot of problems trying to grow revenue for my business this last year. I wanted to move my business to fit a more premium market. By getting Darian [So Magnetic] involved early on in that transition, we were able to get everything designed the way that it should have been. I'm so excited to use our new logo and packaging! Thanks!
