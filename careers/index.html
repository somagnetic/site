      <h1>Looking to work with our team?</h1>
      <h3>Currently, we're not hiring right now.</h3>
      <p>We currently have a working list of freelancers and full time staff.</p>
      <p>However, should you like to be considered on these mobile teams that we put together, why not reach out to us with a link to your portfolio, your contact info, and we'll keep you on tabs should a new project come in that we would love to work with you on.</p>
      <p>We work with people remotely and if location permitting, with our shop here in Everett, Wa. This work is usually fast paced with a need for decently quick turnaround times and communicative responses.</p>
      <p>If you want to be considered for future teams, leave us a message here and we'll go over your work and contact you about being a part of the So Magnetic team.</p>
