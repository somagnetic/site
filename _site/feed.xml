&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-design-strategy&quot;&gt;What is design strategy?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-need-to-opt-for-a-more-professional-process&quot;&gt;Why we need to opt for a more professional process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I may continue to add to this document as the year progresses. So keep tabs on
this. If there‚Äôs anything you want expanded upon, let me know. ü§ì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term means a many different things to designers nowadays. What design
strategy sounds like to one might be completely different to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing to understand about strategy in design is that we are all a part of
it, in both large an small forms, with different roles along the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;but-what-is-strategy-to-designers&quot;&gt;But what is strategy to designers?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve often wondered why this was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job as a designer has been to make a graphic that satisfies the request for
the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a new logo? Done.&lt;br /&gt; You want your website designed? Here ya go.
Here‚Äôs a design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about a friend that I used to design for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relationship in the past was that I ask him what he wanted made and then
made that design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn‚Äôt any strategy or questionnaire. There wasn‚Äôt any focus on value or
improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn‚Äôt even any talk of what happens after the design‚Ä¶ I just made him a
logo and branded his website, two different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was two different designs of the same thing in one year. He eventually
came back to me one last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why wasn‚Äôt the branding sticking? Why did we have to revisit it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agreed to take on the client again, but this time. &lt;strong&gt;We opted for a more
professional process&lt;/strong&gt;.
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://cmps.co/client-onboard-1&quot;&gt;cmps.co/client-onboard-1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I‚Äôve known now for the last 10 months that creating a design
agency based on being valuable to the business would require positioning myself
and my brand as a problem solver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear about it all the time from other designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;we-need-to-be-practicing-design-strategy&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe need to be practicing Design Strategy.‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-hear-these-all-the-time&quot;&gt;You hear these all the time.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theres-some-mystical-art-called-design-strategy&quot;&gt;There‚Äôs some mystical art called design strategy.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn‚Äôt sure where it was practiced the most. Maybe in big business and large
scale design teams?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not very familiar with large scale design teams. But because I eventually
plan on positioning myself around C-level execs doing high budget design, I‚Äôll
have to learn it sooner than later as I get my team together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm currently positioning my design process to uncover value and opportunities
in order to deliver strategic design solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I have planned to write about covers this throughout next year.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://compassofdesign.com/&quot;&gt;Our newsletter will have tons of resources on this
too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole idea of strategy may seem like it comes from designers who are paid a
lot of money from big companies. It seems like they‚Äôve somehow ‚Äúmade it‚Äù as a
designer, a design firm, or team. They‚Äôre the ones getting the really cool
projects to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-because-theyve-found-a-way-to-bridge-the-gap-from-design-to-business&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs because they‚Äôve found a way to bridge the gap from design to business.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You need to find that way of bridging the gap between the business of design and
the design of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;targets-and-metrics&quot;&gt;Targets and Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have goals they are shooting for all the time. Even if it‚Äôs just to
make it through the month without going under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some businesses that have a better system of setting and achieving
goals, and some who need a lot of help defining and measuring success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers may have access to one but not the other, so in order for us to do our
jobs, we need to know what we are trying to do (beyond creating a new logo or
website design) and how we are going to measure the success of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positioning&quot;&gt;Positioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positioning in the marketplace is key to a project‚Äôs success. In order for a
business to position themselves correctly we need to figure out where they exist
now in the market and where they want to go as a result of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start with what the company does, both features and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure out the values they use to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn about their positioning statement built on why someone should choose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then your job is to fulfill that through visual design in order to move them
closer to where they want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sales-and-marketing-funnels&quot;&gt;Sales and Marketing Funnels.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-buyers-journey&quot;&gt;The buyers journey.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnels are a fun topic on why someone should choose to go further into the
brand. At some point what you are designing becomes a piece of this funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a journey through how someone goes from a non-customer into a brand
ambassador. You will have people spread throughout all sections in your target
market or user personas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what frame of mind someone is at when they get to what you are
designing for will help you figure out how to position that piece to convert
them further down the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insight&quot;&gt;Insight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insight comes from poring over company data that is either supplied or collected
during your research phase of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This valuable data frames much of how we approach and attack the problem in
order to remember who and what we are designing for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hint: it‚Äôs probably not the CEO that you are designing for. It‚Äôs the end user
that has to use, see, or interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-strategy-matter&quot;&gt;Why does strategy matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you understand what a business or brand is trying to accomplish, you can
propose a solution that answers the business problem with creativity. ‚Äî&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2fhVNcX&quot;&gt; Douglas
Davis, Creative Strategy and the Business of Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design strategy is our first defense of being relevant in the industry of both
design and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business is transactional.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In order for someone to give up money for a product or service, they need to
value the results more than the money they give up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this puzzle, the focus is bringing people to the business and delivering
value through products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as designers are a piece of that puzzle that, when put together, deliver the
whole picture on what value is behind the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without trying to learn what a business is trying to accomplish, we might
mis-represent the very thing we are trying to help sell. Regardless of how
interesting the design is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies will pay top dollar to get results. And if you don‚Äôt deliver on those
results, or if you never figured out what the results should be, your client
will feel like you failed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client will then either leave you now, or never come back later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-secret-to-design-strategy&quot;&gt;The secret to design strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Design strategy is actually Business Strategy in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/d_evyn/status/915605019512078337&quot;&gt;I had sent out this
tweet&lt;/a&gt;. It was kind of a
revelation because I‚Äôve been reading and studying strategy for designers, only
to learn that design strategy has very little upfront to do with design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I thought about it, the more this quote from Helen Tran (designer) gave
in August rang through my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers need to add value to business in a manner that helps them move the
needle closer to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actual goals a business has when they open for business. They need to
make money, and their form of business provides value of some sorts to their
customers through products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason design strategy is so foreign to designers is that the ability to
design is usually held in a different part of the brain than the skills for
running / managing a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ability to design is usually a separate skill than the skills necessary to
run and manage a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamentally, creativity and logic sit on opposite sides of the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer who spends time giving insights on how you can solve a business
problem with a creative solution will ultimately help you position yourself as
more than a pixel pusher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You essentially earn your seat at the decision table through providing relevant,
creative solutions to difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-the-execution-that-sets-you-apart&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs the execution that sets you apart&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-we-need-to-learn-as-designers&quot;&gt;What do we need to learn as designers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;were-really-good-at-learning-new-design-skillsbr-how-does-this-translate&quot;&gt;We‚Äôre really good at learning new design skills.&lt;br /&gt; How does this translate?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-to-speak-the-language-at-the-table&quot;&gt;Learn to speak the language at the table.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you expect to be included in the high level conversations going on in the
business, especially being able to dictate how something is designed without the
client or management playing ‚Äúcreative director,‚Äù you need to become fairly good
at speaking the language of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to show them that you understand what the metrics and mechanics working
behind the design are and how your work will impact that. I have really good
resources below on this, but you must learn the lingo before you can tango with
the big bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-need-to-learn-to-ask-why&quot;&gt;You need to learn to ask ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By questioning what it is you‚Äôre designing for, you‚Äôre opening the discussion to
figure out the ‚Äúwho‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù we‚Äôre designing this in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the bridge between being tactical (short term) and focusing on strategy
(long term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-out-the-other-goals-at-the-table&quot;&gt;Find out the other goals at the table.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is just one step along the journey of creating a product or service. When
Helen talked about having a ‚ÄúSeat at the table‚Äù above, we need to find out who
else in at that table and learn what their goals are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve ever done a group project before, each person is tasked with a goal
using their best skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each person needs to have communication to make sure they are completing the
same project in the way that compliments the other departments, and that each is
pulling their weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true with your role as designer(s) in the project. Each department
has certain goals to hit. Usually those departments include but aren‚Äôt limited
to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marketing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copywriters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Production&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product Engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers and IT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corporate Offices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer, it should be your duty to help facilitate the success of the
project, and the only way is to learn what they are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm currently working on learning this through action. Me and my current clients
are using their project as a base for my brand strategy process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://compassofdesign.com/community/?=strategy&quot;&gt;Compass of Design
community&lt;/a&gt; will get regular
updates and developments on this process as they happen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats, you‚Äôre now aware of design and it‚Äôs role in business. Even if you knew
about it already, these are still insanely helpful resources to learn more about
design strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôll be covering topics on design strategy for the next year as I work on
learning it myself and practicing it with clients. Until then‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to list resources that I have found to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://compassofdesign.com/books&quot;&gt;The Compass of Design Book List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of every book I‚Äôve found to be helpful as a designer, especially on
design strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2fhVNcX&quot;&gt;Creative Strategy and the business of design.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically this book. This is the best bridge between the language of business
and it‚Äôs translation to design.&lt;br /&gt; (afl) This book is important for designers
trying to bridge that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2xkzGbV&quot;&gt;101 things I learned in Business School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the fastest ways to understand the language that is used
in high level business terms. There‚Äôs illustrations, explanations and quick
snippets of how these terms apply to business. Though it‚Äôs not design centric,
having this knowledge helps you understand what or why a business is talking
about a certain term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.process.st/checklist/brand-identity-design/&quot;&gt;Brand Identity
Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thorough list of every thing you should go over in branding a business with
resources and other sources there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because branding is what I do, this was helpful, but there is a lot of crossover
with other industries&lt;/p&gt;
