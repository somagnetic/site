      <p><img class="client-logo" src="/assets/img/magnet-wordmark-dark.svg" alt="So Magnetic is a strategic branding design agency headquartered close to Seattle, WA. We create magnetic brand identity and custom logo designs for clients to help achieve strategic business goals through design strategy."/>
      </p>
      <h5>So Magnetic doesn't play the same game as other design agencies.</h5>
      <p><strong>We combine your business and market knowledge with our design strategy and the expertise of our team.</strong> In order to achieve the goals you set for the project through design strategy, we work together on the goals and details of the project.</p>
      <p>As an agile company, <strong>the team we select for your project grows or shrinks depending on your project’s needs</strong>. Some projects need a handful of specialists, like wordpress experts who have years of experience making sites for teenagers or a custom icon designer who has sure-fire knowledge of the medical terms, objects, and practices. Each project has its unique opportunities that requires the right team, all the way from junior designers to seasoned experts in the field.
      </p>
      <p><strong>So Magnetic</strong> is spearheaded by <a href="https://twitter.com/darianrosebrook" target="_blank">Darian Rosebrook</a> who is our founder and creative director. Darian has focused his career on defining design strategy and it's corelation to business strategy. He has since been spending his career coaching and mentoring a community of designers who are looking to improve the effectiveness of their design work, becoming connected to some of the best people in the industry. <strong>Your project will be in the hands of the right people who are hand-picked specifically to achieve the goals we outline together for the project.</strong>

      <h3>Working with us</h3>
      <h2>Exceptional design should be delivered along side of a solid business strategy.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="module">
      <h5>Receiving the Request</h5>
      <p>Hiring a professional to handle a project brings peace of mind. To ensure both the client and the professional are on the same page, there are a few things that the professional needs to learn about the project. To achieve this level of understanding, we include a series of questions for starting the process of getting a quote for the work.</p>
      <p>Serious requests are sent directly to us, and we take the utmost care responding to those inquiries. Because of the volume of requests that we have versus our workload, we are greatly selective of the projects we take on, carefully considering each project and our ability to work together. We want us to be able to trust in each other's ability to deliver. </p>

      <h5>Establishing Trust and Roles</h5>
      <p>Communication is key to all relationships. When we connect about starting your project, our first lines of communication are key to the validity of the relationship. You should be confident in our ability keep a solid line of communication and to execute a design that fulfills the requirements. I should be confident that you are willing to and capable of providing goals and content for the project.</p>
      <p>We take pride in the level of professionalism we put forth into the design process. </p>
