      <h1>The Design Process</h1>
      <h3>Establishing Trust and Roles</h3>
      <p>Communication is key to all relationships. When we first connect about starting your project, our first lines of communication are key to the quality of our working relationship and the success of your project. You should be confident in our ability to execute a design that effectively fulfills the goals we outline in your project. We (the team at So Magnetic) should be confident that you are willing to and are capable of providing actionable goals and content material for the project.</p>

    <h3>Receiving the Request</h3>
    <p>Hiring a professional design agency to handle a project should bring you peace of mind. To ensure both the clients and the professionals are on the same page, there are a few things that the professionals need to understand about the project that they will be taking on. To achieve this level of understanding, we include a series of questions for us to build a proposal to quote for the work.</p>
    <p>Serious requests are sent directly to us, and we take the utmost care responding to those inquiries. Because of the volume of requests that we have versus our workload, we carefully choose each project and our ability to work together. We want us to be able to trust in each other's ability to deliver, regardless of the project or goals. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="module">
    <h3>Building a proposal.</h3>
    <p>Truth be told, we are not in the proposal making business. When we determine our ability to work together aligns, we will contact you with some potential questions that help us determine what the scope of the project will be, and clarify anything in your request that will help both of us come to a reasonable price together.</p>
    <p>It wouldn't be fair to you for us to arbitrarily choose what the price for the project will be if it outweighs the expected return on investment you receive from our work together.</p>
    <p>On the other side, it wouldn't be fair to us to be taking on work that would be below what we need in order to run our business and pay the team.</p>
    <p>Together we will work on building a price that's fair to both parties based on the value that you receive from the work that accurately fits the project.</p>
    <p>After signing the proposal, the contract, and paying the first invoice, we will move on to the four pillars of the design process.</p>

    <h2>Industry Research</h2>
    <p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. However, imitation in a world of business brings serious legal trouble. Your design agency needs to know as much as you know about how your current or intended market thinks. Our goal then is to start doing research about your company, your intended audience, and the industry in which you conduct your business. The result of this research drives the effective execution of the goals and a design that feels lke it's a part of your organization. There are standards of excellence with each business and understanding what makes those brands great will help yours achieve the same quality.</p>

    <h3>Project Presentation</h3>
    <p>Every iteration leads to a final solution to what we outline in the beginning of the project. We'll connect through our selected channel of communication to go over the case-study. This case study will be the collection of whatwehave discovered, created, and refined over the course of the project. Any challenges, changes, setbacks, and achievements will be laid out in a digestable manner. How the design fulfills the requirement of the project will be laid out in that document.</p>
    <p>Once the final payment is received, the final iterations, case study, and brand guide will be delivered to you via your method of choice established within our contract.</p>
